A Simple Dungeon Crawler

Instructions

In this game, a horde of undead has locked your adventurer inside a dungeon with many floors.
Your goal is to grab the key, dig for gold, avoid the slimes, and reach the end of each room.
Make your way to the door and try your best to survive. Test your skills on three difficulty levels.
Can you escape the dungeon before running out of moves? Or will you be trapped underground forever?

Type in a letter to control the player token and move it to another place on the map. Good luck!
